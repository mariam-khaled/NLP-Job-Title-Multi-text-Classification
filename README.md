<p>Given a dataset that has two variables (Job title & Industry) in a csv
format of more than 8,500 samples. (download link)
This dataset is imbalanced (Imbalance means that the number of data
points available for different classes is different) as follows:
IT 4746
Marketing 2031
Education 1435
Accountancy 374
It's required to build a model using any Machine Learning classifier
algorithm to classify job titles by the industry and provide us with insights
on how your model works.</p>
